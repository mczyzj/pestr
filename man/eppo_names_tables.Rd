\value{
Check if provided names are present in EPPO SQLite Database, creates
list which contains: data frame with matching names in database and their

\code{eppo_names_table} checks if string (names or parts of the names)
provided by user match any name in the EPPO database. If strings match any
name in database, data frame with all names matching codeid, as well as
preferred (binary), language and EPPOcode is returned. In order to use
functions: \code{eppo_tabletools_names}, \code{eppo_tabletools_cat},
\code{eppo_tabletools_hosts} or \code{eppo_tabletools_distribution}, you need
to run this function first.
